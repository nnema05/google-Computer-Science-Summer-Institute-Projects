This is in the form of a ballet, in which the dance is choreographed with classical music. Ballet productions vary between using elaborate costumes and staging and using minimal costuming and bare staging. Ballet is now a widespread, highly technical form of dance with many subgenres including classic, romantic, neoclassical and contemporary. With six core recognised methods: the Cecchetti method, the Bournoville method, the Vaganova method, the French School, the Royal Academy of Dance method and the Balanchine method, ballet is studied professionally at top dance schools all over the world."

Hip-hop dancing dates back to the early 1970s in New York and California, evolving out of Funk and the development of break beat. Main styles of hip-hop dancing include Breaking, Locking and Popping, with derivative styles emerging out of these including Memphis Jookin’, Turfing, Jerkin’ and Krumping. These were often popularised and made mainstream after being featured in music videos of the time. Today, hip-hop is performed in outdoor spaces, in dance studios and competitively. Unlike many competitive dance styles, hip-hop is often improvisational with dance crews challenging each other to dance battles."

Today, jazz dancing builds on African American vernacular dance styles that emerged along with Jazz music in the US.

These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order to represent real or supernatural phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create wholly abstract visual relationships. An artist’s decision to use a particular medium, such as tempera, fresco, oil, acrylic, watercolour or other water-based paints, ink, gouache, encaustic, or casein, as well as the choice of a particular form, such as mural, easel, panel, miniature, manuscript illumination, scroll, screen or fan, panorama, or any of a variety of modern forms, is based on the sensuous qualities and the expressive possibilities and limitations of those options. The choices of the medium and the form, as well as the artist’s own technique, combine to realize a unique visual image."
